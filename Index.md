# What is ColdBrew ?

Coldbrew is a Go library for creating cloud native applications. It provides a set of libraries for building resilient, secure, and scalable applications. It also provides ready-made components for quickly creating cloud-native applications.

# Why ColdBrew ?

It is a collection of libraries that we have built since 2016 to make our lives easier. We have open-sourced these libraries so that other developers can benefit from them. 

# Who is using ColdBrew ?

ColdBrew is production ready and is used at [gojek](https://www.gojek.com/en-id/) serving billions of requests per day.

# Dont repeat yourself

ColdBrew integrates with all the popular libraries. We strongly believe in the DRY principle. We have integrated with the following libraries:

- [grpc] - ColdBrew is grpc first
- [grpc-gateway] - RESTful APIs
- [prometheus] - Metrics
- [jaeger] - Tracing
- [opentracing] - Tracing
- [hystrix-go] - Circuit Breaker
- [NewRelic] - Monitoring
- [go-grpc-middleware] - Middlewares: interceptors, helpers and utilities.
